## smfirdaus@localhost:~$ whoami

👋 Hi, I’m Firdaus

I’m a Measurement Engineer with over 15 years of experience in the oil, gas, and LNG industry — ensuring precision in metering systems, calibrations, and data management across onshore and offshore operations. My background blends engineering rigor with a strong interest in data analysis, technical writing, and continuous improvement.

Alongside my technical work, I hold a Master’s in Data Science and enjoy exploring how scripting, visualization, and machine learning can enhance industrial systems and decision-making. I’m particularly interested in how we can make technical knowledge more accessible — one markdown note at a time.

This site is my digital space to share notes, ideas, and projects — ranging from flow measurement and auditing, to wellness habits and explorations in technical analysis.

I’m working on being more active here after years of dormancy (hello, 2013 GitHub account!). My goal is to write and share consistently and to grow this space into a friendly, searchable knowledge base.
